---

A [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) template where content is seeded, grown, and intertwined. It's built using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) integrated in the workflow. The sample content has been developed by exploring the subject Information Theory.
