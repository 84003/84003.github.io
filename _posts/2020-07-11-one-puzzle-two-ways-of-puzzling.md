title: One Puzzle, Two Ways of Puzzling
category: project
---

In the form of an experiment, this project investigates how and the degree to which bodily engagement can enhance cognitive performance in a memory-based puzzle. A central claim within the embodied cognition framework — that physical features of the body and its interaction with the environment constitute or contribute to cognition — instigated the investigation. Viewing cognition as embodied contrasts with the traditional view that the mind processes all information, creates mental representations of what is perceived, and uses those representations to control bodily behavior. Cognitive processing is rather understood as embodied, extended, embedded, and enacted — exceeding the inner workings of the skull.
