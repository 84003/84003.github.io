# 404

Oh no! Another case of link rot!

- What does link rot mean?
  - When people try to access a certain link, it no longer points to the intended file, webpage or server.
- Why does this happen?
  - Websites are configured at the URL level, so when webpages are moved, redirected, or reorganized, the addressed are not automatically updated. And so we're lead to an address where there is nothing.
