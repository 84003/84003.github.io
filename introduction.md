Hi, I'm a digital designer based in Norway and The Netherlands. I have a strong affinity for research-based projects that involve churning topics into intelligible content, which can take many forms. Writing, designing, and coding are often a part of that process. Writing is an activity through which I think, and designing is how ideas take shape. I see coding not only as a means for creative output but as a form of practical engagement through which theoretical understanding can emerge.

Presently, I work as a content developer at [XR ERA](https://xrera.eu/) â€” an initiative that brings people from education, research, and industry together to share XR knowledge to foster community development.

Reach out, I'm open to collaborations!

<!-- ### Attributes

### Background -->

<!-- I'm intrinsically inclined to analytical and first-principles thinking, which functions as a means to reverse-engineer problems and yield creative potential. I thrive in environments that foster constructive criticism and feedback and have experience working in interdisciplinary teams. When faced with challenges, I muster a ludicrous level of patience and perseverance and am generally conscientious. My longest-lasting obsession is how information is structured and presented, which manifests in different ways throughout my work.
