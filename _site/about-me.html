<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m a design technologist based in Norway. My affinity lies with research-based projects that involve churning topics into intelligible content and visuals, which can take many forms. Writing, designing, and coding are often a part of that process.</p>

<!-- Writing is an activity through which I think, and designing is how ideas take shape. I see coding not only as a means for creative output but as a form of practical engagement through which theoretical understanding can emerge. -->

<p>My experience ranges from client-based work to projects for research purposes and exhibitions. I’m apt to be involved in concept development through to implementation.</p>

<p>I’m interested in the relationship between cognition and media technology, having developed several hardware and software prototypes exploring new approaches to how we organize, visualize, and interact with information.</p>

<p>Presently, I wear many hats at <a href="https://bioregion.institute/">Bioregion Institute</a> — a design-driven trans-disciplinary applied research team hacking value chains in The Nordic region.</p>

<p>Reach me at hello at rebeccarui dot online.</p>
