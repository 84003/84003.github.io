  <h1>One Puzzle, Two Ways of Puzzling</h1>

  <p>In the form of an experiment, this project investigates how and the degree to which bodily engagement can enhance cognitive performance in a memory-based puzzle. A leading inspiration is one of the central claims within the embodied cognition paradigm, namely that cognitive processing is dependent on physical features of the body so that these are causal or constitutive of the cognitive process itself. Cognitive processing is embodied, extended, embedded, and enacted so that cognition can be understood to exceed beyond the inner workings of the skull.</p>
