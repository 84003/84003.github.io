title: About Me
---

Hi, I’m a design technologist based in Norway. My affinity lies with research-based projects that involve churning topics into intelligible content and visuals, which can take many forms. Writing, designing, and coding are often a part of that process.

<!-- Writing is an activity through which I think, and designing is how ideas take shape. I see coding not only as a means for creative output but as a form of practical engagement through which theoretical understanding can emerge. -->


<!-- My experience ranges from client-based work to projects for research purposes and exhibitions. I’m apt to be involved in concept development through to implementation. -->

I'm interested in the relationship between cognition and media technology, having developed several hardware and software prototypes exploring new approaches to how we organize, visualize, and interact with information.

Presently, I'm a user researcher at [Sanoma Learning](https://www.sanomalearning.com/) working on the [itslearning](https://itslearning.com/) Learning Management System.

Reach me at hello at rebeccarui dot online.
